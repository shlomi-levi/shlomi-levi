# Hi there, I'm Shlomi! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm an aspiring back-end developer, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the Open University of Israel.

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack

Here's a quick overview of the technologies I work with:

- **NodeJS**: Node.js is a powerful and efficient open-source runtime environment that enables server-side execution of JavaScript, allowing developers to build fast and scalable applications.

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and additional features to the language, enhancing code maintainability and enabling developers to catch errors early in the development process.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, making it scalable and suitable for a wide range of applications.

- **Java**: Java is a widely-used, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, as it allows developers to write code once and run it on multiple platforms, making it a popular choice for building robust and scalable applications.

- **Python**: Python is a versatile, high-level programming language that prioritizes code readability and ease of use. It boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries, modules, and frameworks, empowering developers to efficiently build a wide array of applications, ranging from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and automation.

## âš¡ My Projects

Here's a quick overview of the projects I've written:

- **Data Structures Implementations in C**: I have created a C based project that contains implementations for several common data structures, including linked lists, binary trees, Stacks, 
Queues and more.

- **Assembler Project In C**: I have written an assembler project in C, for a pseudo assembly language, as a part of the course 'Workshop In C' in the Open University.

- **Open University Auto-Login**: I have created a Chrome extension (written in TypeScript) that allows a user to save his login details for the Open University's website, and then logs him in automatically each time he enters the university's website.

- **Four In A Row (JavaFX)**: A small game that I had implemented in JavaFX as a part of the course 'Advanced Programming In Java' in the Open University.
