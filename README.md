## âš¡ My Projects

Here's a quick overview of the projects I've written:

- **Vending Machine Library (Python)**: A compact and easy-to-use Python library designed to simulate vending machine operations. The library allows you to effortlessly manage items, payments, and dispense products with just a few lines of code.

- **Yad 2 Auto Renewal (Python)**: A Python project that simplifies the process of selling products on Yad 2. With the power of the Requests library, it automates the ad renewal process, saving you time and effort. Say goodbye to manually refreshing your listings, and keep your ads in the spotlight effortlessly with Yad 2 Auto Renewal.

- **Data Structures Implementations (C)**: A C based project that contains implementations for several common data structures, including linked lists, binary trees, Stacks, 
Queues and more.

- **Assembler Project (C)**: I have written an assembler project in C, for a pseudo assembly language, as a part of the course 'Workshop In C' in the Open University.

- **Open University Auto-Login (TypeScript)**: I have created a Chrome extension that allows a user to save his login details for the Open University's website, and then logs him in automatically each time he enters the university's website.
